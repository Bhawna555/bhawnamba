    "text": "As I expanded my single-page Quarto portfolio into a multi-page site, I realized the benefit of organizing professional content into distinct sections like About, Resume, and Projects. The LLM helped me brainstorm structure and wording.\n\n\nSplitting the content allowed me to personalize each section, especially the Resume and Project pages. I added visual styling and improved professionalism through buttons, spacing, and formatting.\n\n\n\nWhile the LLM provided scaffolding and examples, I customized all content based on my real experience. I cross-verified job descriptions and ensured clarity. I added APA citations if referencing statistics or external ideas.\nThis assignment helped me build not only a website but also a polished professional presentation."
