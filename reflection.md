# Reflection

As I expanded my single-page Quarto portfolio into a multi-page site, I realized the benefit of organizing professional content into distinct sections like About, Resume, and Projects. The LLM helped me brainstorm structure and wording.

## What Worked Better?

Splitting the content allowed me to personalize each section, especially the Resume and Project pages. I added visual styling and improved professionalism through buttons, spacing, and formatting.

## Ensuring Authenticity

While the LLM provided scaffolding and examples, I customized all content based on my real experience. I cross-verified job descriptions and ensured clarity. I added APA citations if referencing statistics or external ideas.

This assignment helped me build not only a website but also a polished professional presentation.
